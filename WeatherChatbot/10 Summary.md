# 10 Summary

Well done, you’ve completed the lab!

Let’s review what we have done…

![](https://github.com/ilyastar12/markdown/blob/main/img2/Picture10.1.1.png)

Created a series of SaaS endpoints to do the lab with. 

Created secure managed connections to each of these endpoints using the CP4I connectors.

Created a facade API and API integration flows to process storm damage claims. 

Tested the connections from within the tooling, building your integration interactively.

Deployed your integration flows as a highly available, scalable resilient Kubernetes deployment of containers and pods onto CP4I runtime on OpenShift

CP4i secured credentials using a Kubernetes secret to abstract credentials from the integration flow

Configured API Connect with a Developer Organization and a Catalog, a secure Gateway and a Portal.

Created an API definition in API connect to securely route the requests to App Connect. Added an API Key security policy to keep your API secure and added a rate-limit policy to manage your API at 100 calls/minute. Published your API to a self-service portal.

Signed up as a new consumer of your API. Registered as a new consumer, used the portal self-service features including the interactive tester.

Created Watson Assistant chatbot and a Node application.
